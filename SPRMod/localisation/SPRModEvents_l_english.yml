 spanish_civil_war:0 "Spanish Civil War"
 spain.1.t:0 "Civil War!"
 spain.1.d:0 "A group of powerful generals in the Armed Forces have issued a pronunciamento, denouncing the current government of Spain! They have launched a right-wing coup with the support of conservative monarchists and the clergy. A significant portion of the military has sided with these Nationalists, but so far they have failed to capture any of Spain's major cities with the exception of Sevilla.\n\nLeftist volunteers are meanwhile flocking to the banners of the Republican government, ready to support it against the rebels. These loyalists may be poorly trained, but no one can question their enthusiasm.\n\nThe battle-lines have been drawn - which faction should we support?"
 spain.1.a:0 "The Nationalists!"
 spain.1.b:0 "The Republicans!"
 spain.99:0 "Civil War Averted!"
 spain.99.t:0 "Civil War Averted!"
 spain.99.d:0 "After a period of explosive tension, it appears that a peace has emerged on the streets of Spain. The amount of violent incidents has slowly been trending downwards, and it seems that the long period of national strife has come to an end. While the problem of radicalism still exists within our society, the flashpoint has passed, and we remain unbroken."
 spain.99.a:0 "¡Viva la Republica!"
 spain.10.d:1 " After the peaceful election of José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones as president of Spain, there was hope that recent years violent uprisings and political turmoil would be put to an end. Rumors that Gil-Robles and CEDA would attempt to create a fascist state have been fueled by their radical policies, and disappearance of several leftist leaders.\nAfter a swift trial, Carabineros officer José Galánfor was convicted of treason and his public execution followed shortly after. Though it was meant as a move to stamp out any will to resist the rise of Nationalist Spain, it had the opposite effect. Leftist volunteers and even a group of generals have flocked to the banners of the newly formed People's Army, ready to support the fight against the oppressive Nationalists. Though most are poorly trained, they have managed to capture several key cities in the chaos that ensued the uprising.\n\nThe battle-lines have been drawn - which faction should we support?"
 spain.10.a:0 " The Rightful Government!"
 spain.10.b:0 " The People's Army!"
 nationalists_chosen:0 "Death to the Rojos!"
 republicans_chosen:0 "Death to the Falangists!"
 communists_chosen:0 "Death to the Republic!"
 anticom_chosen:0 "Death to the Traitors!|
 spain.2.t:0 "Seek International Support?"
 spain.2.d:0 "The coup has not been a complete success, but Carlists, Falangists and the Confederation of the Autonomous Right have managed to mobilize a large part of the army to overthrow the Republic, which has too long allowed our proud Christian nation to fall apart into anarchy. The outcome is still uncertain, with the world watching with concern which side will emerge victorious.\n\nWe did not execute this coup by standing idly by, however, and neither should the world if it wants to crush the red threat. Other nations in the same process of restoring their national glory should be willing to come to our aid."
 spain.2.a:0 "Let's request equipment and munitions."
 spain.2.b:0 "Spain must be won with Spanish blood!"
 spain.3.d:0 "Reactionary and fascist forces in the military have sought to crush the Republic in one swift blow, but did not expect the resistance they met in major cities nor the rapid mobilization of workers' militias. Rather than a coup, they have started a war, war on progress and the future the Spanish people wanted.\n\nDemocratic and socialist nations alike voice support for the Republic, but few dare commit to direct involvement. We could ask them to support our endeavor, or the oppressors will come for their liberty and solidarity next."
 spain.3.a:0 "This is an international struggle to contain fascism!"
 spain.3.b:0 "We will not become a puppet of degenerated workers' states!"
 spain.4.t:0 "Nationalist Spain Wants Our Help"
 spain.4.d:0 "The Spanish Civil War has become a sort of microcosm for our view of the global situation: Communists and liberals seek to destroy old values, and we take up arms to revive them. It is not surprising that the Nationalists in Spain have reached out to us and others to equip them for the coming conflict."
 spain.4.a:0 "We promise to send what we can."
 spain.4.b:0 "If they lack the strength to seize power, they do not deserve it."
 spain.5.t:0 "Republican Spain Wants Our Help"
 spain.5.d:0 "The attempt to overthrow the Second Spanish Republic is a clear signal that the fascists will not allow the flowers of progress to grow even where they naturally take root. The Republicans and their allies, a mix of democrats, communists and anarchists, have turned to us and other parts of the international community for help. Many nations who claim to defend democracy and liberty have withheld their support for fear of being dragged into the war. How do we respond?"
 spain.5.a:0 "Promise them to send arms and equipment."
 spain.4.a.tt:0 "[From.GetName] will be thankful if we arrange a lend-lease during the war."
 spain.5.b:0 "Sadly, we cannot afford to intervene."
 spain.6.t:0 "Nationalist Spain Appreciates our Help"

 spain.7.t:0 "Republican Spain Appreciates our Help"

 spain.8.t:0 "Madrid Reclaimed"
 spain.8.d:0 "The war is won. Madrid is ours again and we have opportunity to make the age old city the center of Spain once again. It has seen much battle and will require rebuilding. What better way to do this than making it our capital?"
 spain.8.a:0 "Move capital to Madrid"
 spain.9.t:0 "Spanish Election of 1936"
 spain.9.d:0 "The Second Republic has proven to be a fragile existence. Manuel Azaña can be president with the backing of the Popular Front, a broad coalition of left-wing groups supported by republicans, communists and anarchists.\n\nBut the right-wing opposition, encompassing conservatives, monarchists and fascists, is also beginning to unite for the cause of bringing down the Popular Front. Whichever coalition falls apart, their opponents are likely to take advantage of their internal conflicts to launch a revolution. This election is not the final test Spain will have to endure to resolve this conflict."
 spain.9.a:0 "Maintain the Popular Front."
 spain.9.b:0 "Unite the Conservative groups under CEDA."
 spain.11:0 "Francoist Terror"
 spain.11.t:0 "Francoist Terror!"

 spain.11.a:0 "Abominable!"
 spain.12:0 "Spanish arms embargo"
 spain.12.t:0 "The Great Powers embargo Spain!"
 spain.12.d:0 "Citing a desire for peace in Europe, and a policy of non-intervention, most of the Great Powers of Europe have signed a treaty to not provide arms to Spain. However, the aid continues to flow in to the Fascists. If we are to have a chance, we must reverse this."
 spain.12.a:0 "We have been betrayed!"
 spain.13:0 "Spanish arms embargo"
 spain.13.t:0 "The Great Powers embargo Spain!"
 spain.13.d:0 "Citing a desire for peace in Europe, and a policy of non-intervention, most of the Great Powers of Europe have signed a treaty to not provide arms to Spain. Shall we stand with them, in the name of neutrality?"
 spain.13.a:0 "Spain doesn't matter anyway."
 spain.13.b:0 "We shall not stand with cowards."
 spain.14:0 "Spain appeals the embargo"
 spain.14.t:0 "Spain pleads for aid!"
 spain.14.d:0 "With aid still pouring in to the Nationalists, and their own war machine starved, Republican Spain pleads to relax the embargo."
 spain.14.a:0 "Better them than the fascists."
 spain.14.b:0 "Spain doesn't matter anyway."
 spain.15:0 "Red Terror"
 spain.15.t:0 "Red Terror!"

 spain.16.t:0 "Dispatch the Condor Legion?"
 spain.16.d:0 "The legitimate Spanish government under Franco has requested the services of our volunteer Condor Legion to aid them against the Republicans. Should we authorize this?"

 spain.18.t:0 "Crowning the King"
 spain.18.d:0 "Now that the monarchy has been formally restored, it is time to choose our king. While all of the candidates hold great prestige, they are guaranteed to anger the supporters of the opposing faction. To avoid a succession war, we must be decisive with our choice."
 spain.18.a:0 "Alfonso XIV - the Alfonsists' choice!"
 spain.18.b:0 "Javier I - the Carlists' choice!"
 spain.18.c:0 "Carlos VIII - the Carlists' Habsburg archduke!"
 spain.18.e:0 "Jaime V - the true Alfonsist heir!"
 spain.19:0 "German Tank Imports"
 spain.19.t:0 "German Tank Imports"
 spain.19.d:0 "Nationalist Spain has sent us an offer for 150 tanks with which to fight the Republicans. The price is quite low, but pulling them into our pocket once and for all could make it worthwhile."

 spain.19.b:0 "Decline the deal"
 spain.20:0 "The Issue of the Political Prisoners"
 spain.20.t:0 "The Issue of the Political Prisoners"
 spain.20.d:0 "One of our greatest campaign promises was to free the political prisoners being held after the 1934 Asturian Revolution. While releasing them will expand our own support, it could also impact the state of the nation and be seen as favoring our supporters over law and order."
 spain.20.a:0 "Their sentences are legitimate."
 spain.20.b:0 "Free only nonviolent offenders."
 spain.20.c:0 "Liberate them all!"
 spain.21:0 "Rehiring the Workers"
 spain.21.t:0 "Rehiring the Workers"
 spain.21.d:0 "The previous right-wing government fired many government workers for political reasons, without due process. A campaign promise of ours was to reverse this. How should we treat the issue?"

 spain.23.t:0 "The Issue Of General Ochoa"
 spain.23.d:0 "Eduardo López Ochoa is the general who lead the troops which crushed the Asturian Revolution. We must deal with him in some way or another. To not punish him would be seen as a betrayal by our far left-wing elements."

 spain.24:0 "Addressing the Army's Loyalties"

 spain.25.a:0 "Condemn the Guardia Civil, but otherwise do nothing."
 spain.25.b:0 "Expand police presence - shut down the paramilitaries."
 spain.25.c:0 "Legitimize the Assault Guards, and break the Guardia Civil by force!"
 spain.26:0 "The Issue of the Unión Militar Española"
 spain.26.t:0 "The Issue of the Unión Militar Española"
 spain.26.d:0 "We have become aware of a concerning movement within our army, the Unión Militar Española. This organization has significant ties with the Falangists, and there is significant risk that they could be organizing a coup. We must act quickly on this issue."
 spain.26.a:0 "Investigate the organization, but keep it intact."
 spain.26.b:0 "Demand that it, as well as the UMRA, cease their operations."
 spain.26.c:0 "Legitimize the Unión Militar Republicana Antifascista, and shut UME down!"
 spain.27:0 "The Purge is Successful!"
 spain.27.t:0 "The Purge is Successful!"

On one side, we could appeal to the democratic minor nations of the Benelux, as well as Ireland and other less-influential nations. On the other, we could open up our ports and markets to truly impartial trade, from nations of all ideology groups.

 spain.71.d:0 "While both of our nations have taken much wealth from our colonies, it appears that a new issue is on the table. In order to further secure the Mediterranean, it could be possible to pool both Spanish and French resources to create a unified Moroccan state. This would serve as another Mediterranean guardian, as well as a source of democratic influence and self-governance in an increasingly rebellious Africa.\n\n While we are officially resistant to any appeal to decolonization, this action may influence the fiercely anti-colonialist United States to take our side in any future conflicts, as well as further enhance our ties with our neighbor."
